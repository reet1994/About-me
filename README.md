I have completed Post Graduate Diploma in Data Science from Analytix Labs. Being a Major in Economics has helped me look at business problems from a different angle. I have learnt MS Excel, Python, SQL, Tableau, Machine Learning, NLP etc. as this field generated a lot of interest in my mind.

I look forward to learning something new everyday, I am currently immersed in new projects available at Kaggle. My project work is available in Kaggle and Github.

I have completed 2 internships from iNeuron.ai and YoShops.com in past 3 months.
